# Turtle Race

![Turtle Race](turtle_race.png)

Welcome to the Turtle Race project! This is a simple Python application using the Turtle graphics library, where you can organize a race between turtle players. The turtles will race to the finish line, and the winner will be displayed. Additionally, the time taken by each player to reach the finish line will be recorded.

## How it Works

1. The game initializes a playing field and displays a start line and a finish line.
2. You can enter the number of players (turtles) who will participate in the race.
3. For each player, you will be prompted to enter their name.
4. Once all the players are set up, the race begins when you run the game.
5. Turtles move forward with random speeds, and the first turtle to reach the finish line is declared the winner.
6. The time taken by each player to reach the finish line is displayed.
7. The game also announces the winner.
